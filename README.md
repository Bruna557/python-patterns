# Example application code for the python architecture book

A product is identified by a SKU, pronounced “skew,” which is short for stock-keeping unit. Customers place orders. An order is identified by an order reference and comprises multiple order lines, where each line has a SKU and a quantity.

The purchasing department orders small batches of stock. A batch of stock has a unique ID called a reference, a SKU, and a quantity.

We need to allocate order lines to batches. When we've allocated an order line to a batch, we will send stock from that specific batch to the customer's delivery address. When we allocate x units of stock to a batch, the available quantity is reduced by x.

We can't allocate to a batch if the available quantity is less than the quantity of the order line. Batches have an ETA if they are currently shipping, or they may be in warehouse stock. We allocate to warehouse stock in preference to shipment batches. We allocate to shipment batches in order of which has the earliest ETA.
